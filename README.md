# Word-Day-Scheduler
The purpose of this assignment was to keep record of activities during different hours of the day.
Each time slot has the ability to record user input with local storage when the save button is clicked.
Depending on the time of day, the application will display a color to represent if the time slot is past,present or future.
Past is red, present is blue and future is green.
With the help of my instructor, I was able to use moment to able to have the scheduler to use the actual time to determine if the time slots
fall under past,present or future.
